# MM Finances React

## About

MM Finances is a web app that helps you track how you spend your money.

The idea for this app came from a friend of mine who used a difficult to understand spreadsheet to work out how he spends his income. I tried to come up with a solution to make this process easier and more visually pleasing, and MM Finances is what I ended up with.

This app consumes the <a href="https://github.com/bobel95/mihmih-finances-api">MM Finances API</a>
